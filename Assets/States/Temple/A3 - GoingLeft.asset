  storyText: "As you proceed through this path you start to see a faint orange glow
    coming from a turn at the end of the corridor.\r\n\r\nWith the extra light you
    take a figurine from the ground, made of some solid material you can't quite identify.
    It resembles a humanoid creature with a strange shaped head, maybe a god cultured
    by the temple.\r\n\r\n\"This might be worth something\"\r\n\r\n1- Keep walking\r\n2-
    Turn back away from the light"
